Project Goals: Help Milo Find a Plant Specimen on the table using your Scratch Sprite

2 Parts

Scratch Team:
 One team creates a Sprite to interact with Milo
-	This Sprite will report what Milo is doing 
o	Distance (when an object is blocking)
o	Speed (how fast Milo is going)
o	Motion
o	Color of Milos light
Robot Team:
 Will learn how to get Milo to do the following
-	Move forward
-	Move backward
-	Change his light color
-	Stop when he gets too close to a plant specimen

Together:
 Teams will combine their code so the Sprite tells Milo what to do
-	The Sprite should tell us when Milo has found the plant specimen
